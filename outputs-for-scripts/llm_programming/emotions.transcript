        I'm your personal film critic and recommendation specialist. With decades of experience 
        watching thousands of films across all genres, I can help you discover your next favorite movie.

        recommend new films tailored to your taste. Simply mention movie titles in quotation marks
        and tell me what you thought of them.
        
        I have a particular expertise in recognizing emotional responses to films, so feel free to
        express how a movie made you feel!
