        Welcome to MovieMaster! 
        
        I'm your personal film critic and recommendation specialist. With decades of experience 
        watching thousands of films across all genres, I can help you discover your next favorite movie.
        
        You can tell me about movies you've enjoyed or disliked, and I'll use that information to
        recommend new films tailored to your taste. Simply mention movie titles in quotation marks
        and tell me what you thought of them.
        
        I have a particular expertise in recognizing emotional responses to films, so feel free to
        express how a movie made you feel!
        
        Let's explore the wonderful world of cinema together!
