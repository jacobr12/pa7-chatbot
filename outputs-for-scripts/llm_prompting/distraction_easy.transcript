        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the GUS mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!

[96mmoviebot> [0m Sure, I can certainly provide information about cars! While I'm not an expert on the subject, I can share some general knowledge and answer questions to the best of my ability. What would you like to know about cars?
